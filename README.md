## Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund

-----

This stock screener project is based on the freeCodeCamp.org Algorithmic Trading Using Python Course.

The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&P 500, is a stock market index tracking the stock performance 
of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly 
followed equity indices. As of December 31, 2020, more than $5.4 trillion was invested in assets tied to 
the performance of the index.

The S&P 500 index is a market capitalization-weighted index. The index is one of the factors 
in computation of the Conference Board Leading Economic Index, used to forecast the direction of the 
economy.

## A Quantitative Momentum Investing Strategy

-----

Momentum investing means investing in the stocks that have increased in price the most.

For this project, we're going to build an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the highest 
price momentum. From there, we will calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 
50 stocks.

## Building A Quantitative Value Investing Strategy

-----

Value investing means investing in the stocks that are cheapest relative to common measures of business 
value (like earnings or assets).

For this project, we're going to build an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the best 
value metrics. From there, we will calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 
50 stocks.
